//(6) when you are outside of the head and outside of functions, you can use just two slashes to leave single-line comments like this and you don't need to close

//(7) just below here you see "var," declaring mymap as a variable, then setting your map parameters. You can redefine features of a variable in your code as needed.
//    you could actually name this anything "mymap," "kevin," "hammercheese," et cetera, as long as you call it up the same way each time throughout the code
//(8) note that you might also see "const" used to identify variables in code, when you want a CONSTANT variable. Functionally, these will tend to work similarly in our work.
// (9) here you define the longitude, latitude, and zoom level of the user map when they load the page, then follow with the tile layer you want (here it is mapbox)

	}).addTo(mymap);
//(10) right above here, you see you're adding this tileset and setting the max zoom level of "mymap" 

//(11) this is how you define individual features on the map - a marker, a cirlce, a polygon. You could also call up a variable and point it to a hosted GIS file to load it in.
//(12) note that each popup has preloaded text here. You could also have a variable that points attributes in a dataset to populate a popup; we will do this in the future

		color: 'green',
		fillColor: '#f03',
		fillOpacity: 0.5
	}).addTo(mymap).bindPopup("I am a circle.");
	//(13)notice that you can set the color of the outline by using major color names, as well as the fill color with hex codes

	]).addTo(mymap).bindPopup("I am a polygon.");
	//(14)three nodes - the above code is drawing is a triangle... you can add more nodes to the polygon by separating each with a comma

	//(15)here you could set the attributes of the popup instead of setting each to specific text
	var popup = L.popup();

	
		var LoveLibrary = {
    "type": "Feature",

};

//(16) you can also comment out mapped items if you do not want them to draw. note that the var reference above is still present but below i have turned off a layer
//	L.geoJSON(LoveLibrary,{}).addTo(mymap);

//(17) think about how you would write some pop up text into your Love Library layer. Look at how it is done above. Read online help. Ask your neighbor. There are multiple approaches!
